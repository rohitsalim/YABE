           The model has a central position in a Play! application. It is the domain-specific 
           representation of the information on which the application operates.
                    
           Martin fowler defines it as :
                        
           Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the 
           business situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation 
           is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of storing it are 
           delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is the heart of business software.
